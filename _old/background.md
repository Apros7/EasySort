# ReUseSortingBot

See [Linear](https://linear.app/reuse) for issues, vision, etc.

Project for me to learn basics of mechatronics & design + some 3d modelling and printing

Under development...

Physical robot with inspiration from:
1. Surgery robot: [Micheal Reaves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_BlNA7bBxo&t=383s&ab_channel=MichaelReeves)
2. Robotic arm with suction cup: [Automatic Addiction](https://automaticaddison.com/robotic-arm-with-vacuum-suction-cup-for-pick-and-place/)
3. [DIY CNC Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=covhU4L5N5g&ab_channel=BenMakesEverything)
4. [4 axis scara Z-arm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e11BQrpTd9I&ab_channel=HITBOTROBOTICS)
5. [Conveyor belt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoejrZhn5XI&ab_channel=EasyHomeMadeProjects)

### Design components:
- [Suction cup](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Suction-Gripper-Mechanical-Controller-Intelligent/dp/B0C373ML4X/ref=sr_1_17?crid=3VAWPE1RVIUCW&keywords=suction%2Bcup%2Brobot%2Barm&qid=1701639653&sprefix=suction%2Bcup%2Brobot%2Barm%2Caps%2C82&sr=8-17&th=1)

### Where is this project currently?
See [tests]()

### Design specifications:
A collection of requirements the machine has to meet:
- [ ] Movement in 1 dimension
- [ ] Movement in 2 dimensions
- [ ] Movement in 3 dimensions
- [ ] Suction cup and manual pickup
- [ ] Implementation of conveyor belt
- [ ] Material Detection
- [ ] Pickup of static material
